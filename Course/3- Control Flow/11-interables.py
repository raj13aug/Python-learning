# Range function return an object of range.

# In python we have primitive types like numbers, strings and booleans
#  Also have complex types, range is an example
# Iterable which mean you can iterate over it and use it in a for loop.

# Strings are also iterable.

for x in "Python":
    print(x)

# complex another object called list

for x in [1, 2, 3]:
  print(x)

# custom object creation, It's different structure compare with (primitive types like numbers, strings and booleans)
